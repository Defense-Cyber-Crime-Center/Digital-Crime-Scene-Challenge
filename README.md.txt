Thank you for your interest in the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) Digital Crime Scene Challenge!  This package contains all materials needed to run your own instance of this Challenge at your own event or as a training tool:

* Four scenarios that include a full set of interrogation questions for the Challenge
* The source code for the web application, along with tutorials on how to use it
* The basic rules for the Challenge participants along with our recommended presentation
* A recommended inventory list of all the items hidden at the crime scene
* An evidence map of the placement of all digital and non-digital items for event execution
* Backup grading forms should you prefer paper grading and not use the web application

We hope that this Challenge serves the greater community in continuing its purpose: educate participants on the issues Investigators currently face in the field with potential sources of digital evidence, while keeping their attention through a fun and interactive competition.

Sincerely,

*Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center ([DC3](http://www.dc3.mil))*


Overview
---------------------------------------

The object of the Digital Crime Scene Challenge is for participants to use their forensic and investigative skills to focus on potential digital evidence and conduct triage/analysis of such evidence. Teams of 1-5 participants are given a scenario and an interrogation script of a suspect. The scenario and script outline that there is vital information to be found – without it, the suspect must be let go! It is the team’s job to review the case information and analyze the scene quickly. 

Participants need to find all the evidence items and the key device with the vital information stored on it in less than 15 minutes. Points are awarded for:
- Each evidence item found and secured
- Identifying the key device 
- Finding the vital information on the device 

If there is a tie with points, the team with the fastest time will win. The goal of this challenge is to educate participants on the issues Investigators currently face, while keeping their attention through a fun and interactive competition.
